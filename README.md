NaveGo: an open-source MATLAB/GNU-Octave toolbox for processing integrated navigation systems and performing inertial sensors profiling analysis.

NaveGo (ˈnævəˈgəʊ) is an open-source MATLAB/GNU Octave toolbox for processing integrated navigation systems and simulating inertial sensors and a GNSS receiver. It also performs inertial sensors analysis using the Allan variance. It is freely available online. It is developed under MATLAB/GNU-Octave due to this programming language has become a *de facto* standard for simulation and mathematical computing.

NaveGo's motto is "to bring integrated navigation to the masses".

NaveGo is supported at the moment by three academic research groups: GridTICs at the National University of Technology (Argentina), LabSin at the National University of Cuyo (Argentina), and DIATI at the Politecnico di Torino (Italy).

## Attention!

Please, if you found a bug or error in the source code of NaveGo, you should open a new [issue](https://github.com/rodralez/NaveGo/issues). 

But, if you have any question of any kind or you want to share some feedback about NaveGo, please leave a comment at the [discussion forum](https://github.com/rodralez/NaveGo/discussions). 


## Features

Main features of NaveGo are:

* Processing of an inertial navigation system (INS).

* Processing of a loosely-coupled integrated navigation system (INS/GNSS).

* ***NEW*** Compass heading using magnetometers. 

* ***NEW*** Processing of a loosely-coupled integrated navigation system with magnetometers (INS/GNSS/MAG).

* Simulation of inertial sensors and GNSS.

* Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) detection algorithm.

* Allan variance technique to characterize inertial sensors' both deterministic and stochastic errors.


## NaveGo Mathematical Model

The underlying mathematical model of NaveGo is based on the two following articles:

* R. Gonzalez, J.I. Giribet, and H.D. Patiño. NaveGo: a simulation framework for low-cost integrated navigation systems, Journal of Control Engineering and Applied Informatics, vol. 17, issue 2, pp. 110-120, 2015. [Download](http://ceai.srait.ro/index.php?journal=ceai&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=2478).

* R. Gonzalez, J.I. Giribet, and H.D. Patiño. An approach to benchmarking of loosely coupled low-cost navigation systems. Mathematical and Computer Modelling of Dynamical Systems, vol. 21, issue 3, pp. 272-287, 2015. [Download](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13873954.2014.952642).

Be aware that the original Kalman filter state vector has been reduced from 21 to 15 states.


##  NaveGo Model Validation

NaveGo has been validated by processing real-world data from a real trajectory and contrasting results against Inertial Explorer, a commercial, closed-source software package. Differences between both solutions have shown to be negligible. For more information read the following paper:

## Roadmap

Future features of NaveGo will be:

* Barometer as aiding sensor for altitude.

# Contributions

We are looking for contributors to NaveGo! Since integrated navigation is a topic used in several fields such as Geomatics, Geology, Mobile Mapping, Autonomous Driving, and even Veterinary (yes, Veterinary!) for animal tracking, we hope other communities other than the navigation community compromise and contribute to this open-source project.

You can contribute in many ways:

* Writing code.
* Writing a manual.
* Reporting bugs.
* Suggesting new features.

If you are interested in joining NaveGo, please feel free to contact Dr. Rodrigo Gonzalez at rodralez [at] frm [dot] utn [dot] edu [dot] ar.


# Examples

The `example` folder contains several types of examples which try to be a kind of user manual for NaveGo.

## Allan variance example

This example can be analyzed by just executing the file `navego_example_allan.m`. Firstly, Allan variance is applied to 2-hours of real static measurements from a Sensonor STIM300 IMU. Then, almost 5 hours of synthetic inertial data are created and Allan variance is run on these simulated data.


## INS/GNSS integration example using synthetic (simulated) data

The NaveGo example with synthetic data is based on the output of a trajectory generator. This program provided both truth accelerations and angular velocities for a previous defined trajectory. NaveGo does not provide a trajectory generator.

The file `navego_example_synth.m` tries to expose how NaveGo can be used step by step. Two IMU measurements are simulated according to the error profiles of ADIS16405 IMU and ADIS16488 IMU. Then, both IMU are fused using a simulated GNSS sensor. Finally, performances of the two simulated INS/GNSS systems are compared.

## INS/GNSS integration example using real data

Two examples of how to use NaveGo to post-process real data are provided as `navego_example_real_xxxx.m`, one for Ekinox-D IMU and another for MPU-6000 IMU. Both IMUs are integrated with Ekinox-D GNSS. These datasets were generated by driving a vehicle through the streets of Turin city (Italy).

These two real examples are part of the data collection used in the article (Gonzalez and Dabove, 2019).
